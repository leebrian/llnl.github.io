# CDCGov Software Catalog

Fork of https://github.com/LLNL/llnl.github.io (Author: Ian Lee <lee1001@llnl.gov>) to display stats on CDC repositories.

Welcome to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory software portal! The purpose of this software portal is to serve as a hub for open source software that is produced by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

LLNL produces software on a daily basis. Some of this software is used only internally, other components are licensed for use by external partners and collaborators, still other software is released, or even actively developed, in the open on software hosting platforms such as GitHub.com, Bitbucket.org, Sourceforge.net, and others.

### Getting Started

To work locally, you can use `bundler` to install the Ruby dependencies, and then run the development web server with:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Followed by opening http://localhost:4000 in a web browser.

#### Deployment

To deploy updated content, use:

```
make deploy
```

This will build the site, and rsync it to the staging server. The staging server is sync'd to the production server every 15 minutes. So be patient. :)

### Contact

If you have any questions or would like to request a private repository, please don't hesitate to contact [Ian Lee](mailto:ian@llnl.gov) or one of [the GitHub organization admins](mailto:github-admin@llnl.gov).
