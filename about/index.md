Welcome to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory software portal! The purpose of this software portal is to serve as a hub for open source software that is produced by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

LLNL produces software on a daily basis. Some of this software is used only internally; other components are licensed for use by external partners and collaborators; and still other software is released, or even actively developed, in the open on software hosting platforms such as GitHub.com, Bitbucket.org, Sourceforge.net, and others.
